This dashboard is a well-structured, interactive tool that provides users with a comprehensive view of microbiome data. The use of both Bubble and Bar Charts to represent microbial diversity and abundance is very effective for visualizing and comparing different samples. The interactivity (through the dropdown) and dynamic updates make it user-friendly and provide an excellent experience for exploring the data.
